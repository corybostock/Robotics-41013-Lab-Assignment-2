Project Name: #Saladbot

Robot:  Sawyer

Project Description (100 words):

We have identified the lack of time most people have to prepare healthy nutritious meals. We plan to use the identified robot as a kitchen aid to assemble fresh salads. This is the robotâ€™s main application but not limited use. The robot will be capable or picking and placing a variety of ingredients, as well as assembling and tossing the salad.  Safety measures will be implemented (eStops, barriers, etc) such that it is safe to work alongside in the kitchen.
